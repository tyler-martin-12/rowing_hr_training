# Rowing Heart Rate Training
This is a data visualization project to show how fitness changes over time with training. The data was collected through my own training on concept2 rowing machine and a Polar H7 HR monitor.

The jupyter notebook contains details about how the gif `rowing_training.gif` was created from the data.
